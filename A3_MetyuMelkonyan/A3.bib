abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}}

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Evidence from observational studies suggests that
              chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with
              extrahepatic cancers. However, the causal association between
              chronic HBV infection and extrahepatic cancers remains to be
              determined. METHODS: We performed two-sample Mendelian
              randomization (MR) to investigate whether chronic HBV infection
              is causally associated with extrahepatic cancers. We identified
              four independent genetic variants strongly associated (P-value <
              5 $\times$ 10(-8)) with the exposure, chronic HBV infection in
              1371 cases and 2938 controls of East Asian ancestry in Korea,
              which were used as instrumental variables. Genome-wide
              association summary level data for outcome variables, that
              included cancer of the biliary tract, cervix, colorectum,
              endometrium, esophagus, gastric, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung,
              ovary and pancreas were obtained from Biobank Japan. FINDINGS:
              Using the multivariable inverse variance weighted method, we
              found genetic liability to chronic HBV infection causally
              associated with extrahepatic cancers including cervical cancer
              (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95\% confidence interval [CI] =
              1.29-1.91, P-value = 0.0001) and gastric cancer (OR = 1.12, 95\%
              CI = 1.05-1.19, P-value = 0.0001). Moreover, chronic HBV
              infection (OR = 1.20, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.34, P-value = 0.0021) was
              causally associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, supporting a
              well-established association between chronic HBV infection and
              hepatocellular carcinoma. INTERPRETATION: Our MR analysis

ABSTRACT = {The discovery of the tumor suppressor p53, through its interactions with proteins of tumor-promoting viruses, paved the way to the understanding of p53 roles in tumor virology. Over the years, accumulating data suggest that WTp53 is involved in the viral life cycle of non-tumor-promoting viruses as well. These include the influenza virus, smallpox and vaccinia viruses, the Zika virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1, Human herpes simplex virus-1, and more. Viruses have learned to manipulate WTp53 through different strategies to improve their replication and spreading in a stage-specific, bidirectional way. While some viruses require active WTp53 for efficient viral replication, others require reduction/inhibition of WTp53 activity. A better understanding of WTp53 functionality in viral life may offer new future clinical approaches, based on WTp53 manipulation, for viral infections.},
