### Part 1: Non-thresholded Gene set Enrichment Analysis

I have used GSEA (4.3.2) (4) non-thresholded gene set enrichment method. I have used Bader Lab geneset of Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_March_01_2021_symbol.gmt including no HUGO symbols and EI published in March 1 2021. It was released in 2023 of Human MiSigDB. I used no collapse to remap gene symbols to avoid the confusion. 200 max gene size and 15 min gene size to have more stringent values. I used 1000 number of permutations. Therefore, GSEA resulted in more stringent non-EMT values that are shown to be enriched. There is very  genes that are known to be involved in apoptotic process of Cancer cell.The top gene set at the positive geneset is TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION BY SMALL RNAS%REACTOME%R-HSA-5578749.3	 with 0.784 FDR-qvalue and 0.001 Nominal p-value and 0.98 ES score. The top gene set for negative is PHOSPHOLIPASES%HUMANCYC%LIPASYN-PWY with 0FDR and 0 p-value and-0.65 ES This correlated with our previous results that our our log CPM is always negative, there is no positive logCPM values. This was our previous hypothesis that almost every gene treated showed higher expression with the treatments the authors did to induce the oncogenes. Most of the genesets are Virus related. Furthermore, there are known to be virus effect on pancreas cancer and liver cancer such as chronic Hepatitis C and chronic Hepatitis B (6) A significant proportion of these pathways are systematic disease causing viruses such as Epstein Barr virus and HIV-1 viruses. The negative results actually contain more oncogenic pathways such that the apoptosis and salicid acid synthesis genesets are more prevalent as opposed to positive.

### Part 2: Visualize your Gene set Enrichment Analysis in Cytoscape

![ Figure 5: Publication ready figure of Gene Enrichment visualization (7)](/Users/mac/Desktop/BCB420/A3_MetyuMelkonyan/images/Publication.png)



The enrichment map Cytoscape visualization was done by using stringent 0.05 p-value and ver permissive 0.5 FDR values (7) The reason why I used 0.5 for FDR is that. Furthermore, Jaccard + Overlap coefficient 0.375 and combined coefficient 0.5 were used. In total there are 291 nodes (including hidden) and 763 edges (including hidden edges) in the visualization.There are more gene sets that I find to be associated each other. Even apoptotic genesets are related to those of viral infection genesets. This supports the presence of viral effect on pancreas cancer as well as many other cancer types.

The post analysis includes the signature geneset from Bader genesets (5)  of Human symbols of Drugbank approved geneset. p53 is an oncogene and it is involved in many pathways that are known to be causing different types of cancers.It is apparent that p53 is associated with viral pathways as well as some oncogenic pathways. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the viral effect on oncogenic genes for triggering tumors is indeed true.  Post analysis coefficient of 0.25 Mann-Whitney cut off (Two-sided) was used. Post analysis results also show that p63 mainly involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. ROS are known to be tumor growth promoter which then cause EMT in different human tissues as well as trigger cancer at different type.

The sialic acid pathway is one of the pathways that is known to be affecting tumor proliferation, cell growth, cell detachment and as a result metastasis. It is known to be at highly expressed by the cancer cell. Moreover, cancer triggered apoptosis is one of the results of sialic acid. Neu5Ac 9-phosphate synthase (NANS)( encircled red) is an enzyme in sialic acid metabolism.NANS role in sialic acid pathways on figure. Also, glycolipid-bound sialic acids is highly found in cancer cells.Finally, by having high expression levels and visualized on the pathway analysis NANS has a potential to be an oncogene.

### Part 4: Interpretation and detailed view of results


1.Do the enrichment results support conclusions or mechanism discussed in the original paper? How do these results differ from the results you got from Assignment 2 thresholded methods ?

  Yes, the enrichment results support the conclusion. It not only supports the conclusion of EMT genes that are known to be unregulated and found on the positive side of the gene enrichment analysis, but also a finding of viral effect. This viral effect on different types of cancer has been discussed in different literature. However, as it is apparent the cancer oncogene p53 has relationship with oncogenic viral cancer-inducing genes. Further research is required to illustrate for both pancreas cancer and for many other cancer. The results that we obtained from the thresholded analysis is partly different from what we obtained from the non-thresholded analysis. I am confident that this is due to the geneset difference as well as experimental errors in data analysis. However, we were lucky to get partial positives results and conclude similarly to the main paper conclusion.


2.Can you find evidence, i.e. publications, to support some of the results that you see. How does this evidence support your result ?
  
(9) discusses p53 manipulation by oncogenic viruses and shows a clear picture of possible non-oncogenic viruses. Our analysis results showed clear indications of HIV, E1b(Ebstein Barr virus) effect on cell apoptosis. Also cellular degradation pathways are partially visualized on our enrichment map. They are also associated with viral metabolic activity such as HIV (shown on degradation side)(9)
